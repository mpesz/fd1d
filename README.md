# fd1d
WHAT:
	Family of MATLAB codes for solving simple PDEs in 1d.

FILES:
	README.md: 	this file,
	fd1d.pdf:  	description of what the code does, with examples,
	fd1d.m: 	code that solves the two-point boundary value problem (Poisson Eq in 1d),
	fd1d_heat:	code that solves the initial value two-boundary point diffusion equation in 1d (Heat Eq),
	compressible_single_phase.m: code that solves slightly compressible Darcy fluid flow problem in subsurface.
